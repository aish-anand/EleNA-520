# EleNa: Elevation-based Navigation

The usual Navigation System tries to get the shortest or the fastest path from one point to another. However, in some cases, having the ability to further customize the path is desirable. Such a case could arise if, while working out, following a path that maximizes or minimizes the elevation gain is more convenient than the usual shortest path in order to get better training results. Therefore, the EleNa project tries to find the best path between two points according to the user preferences regarding elevation gain and some distance constraint with respect to the shortest path.
